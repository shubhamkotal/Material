IMR accepts the proposed compensating control for the absence of vendor-specific UAT reports prior to go-live, considering the interim risk mitigation measures in place. The ongoing close monitoring by the Fraud and Product teams post-launch, along with established HELIOS controls for fraud rule and system performance, provide a reasonable level of oversight. Furthermore, the development of a Third-Party Key Operated Control within HELIOS strengthens monitoring of vendor model performance. Given Zelle's nature as an industry model and the vendor’s IP constraints limiting direct access to score values, these controls are considered appropriate to manage model risk until the final UAT Test Activity Completion Certificate (TACC) is provided.

IMR accepts the compensating control for the absence of HSBC-specific model performance evaluation and accuracy-based metrics, considering the ongoing post-launch monitoring framework. The active involvement of Fraud and Product teams in tracking key metrics, coupled with existing HELIOS controls for fraud rule and system performance, ensures continuous oversight. Additionally, the development of a Third-Party Key Operated Control within HELIOS enhances monitoring of the vendor model’s performance. Given the vendor’s IP constraints preventing direct access to score-level data and Zelle’s positioning as an industry model, the proposed controls are deemed adequate to manage the associated model risk until comprehensive performance evaluation on internal data can be conducted.
