Thanks for the clarification. Your approach of comparing algorithms at each stage is noted and methodologically sound in general practice. However, in this case, the concern remains valid because the variable selection was performed within LightGBM, but the final model was built using Random Forest. These two algorithms optimize different aspects (bias vs. variance), so variables identified as important in LightGBM may not be equally optimal for Random Forest. This creates a design inconsistency that could explain the observed instability between training, test, and out-of-time results.

Thanks for the clarification. You haven’t highlighted any factual inaccuracy — your response rightly points to the limitation of achieving parity across all parameters, which is reasonable and can be noted during the action plan closure. However, the MRI not only refers to representativeness gaps but also to the absence of detailed data quality checks such as duplicate removal, outlier correction, bias verification after missing value treatment, and multicollinearity assessment. These aspects collectively affect the overall data quality and representativeness, which could contribute to the observed model instability. Hence, while your clarification is acknowledged, the MRI remains valid as raised.
