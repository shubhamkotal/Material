MRI #XX: Lack of clarity and component-level coverage in model documentation
Severity: MEDIUM (New)

Description:
The current model documentation is not sufficiently clear for third-party understanding, as it frequently references the overall DIVA model rather than explicitly documenting the in-scope component model, DIVA BIO ID. Model design, scope, and performance discussions are presented at an aggregate DIVA level, with no standalone explanation or performance assessment for the DIVA BIO ID component. While supporting metrics such as selfie capture rates have been provided and relate to a key element of the in-scope model, the absence of clear component-level documentation and performance reporting limits transparency and hinders a focused assessment of the DIVA BIO ID model.

Business risk / consequence and justification of severity:
Lack of clear, component-level documentation may result in misinterpretation of model scope and performance, reducing the effectiveness of governance, review, and independent challenge. This can weaken oversight and limit confidence in the model’s ongoing suitability. However, given that overall DIVA model performance is satisfactory and key indicators for the DIVA BIO ID component demonstrate acceptable outcomes, there is no evidence of immediate business or customer impact. Accordingly, the residual risk is assessed as Medium.
