mri #XX: absence of ethics checklist for customer selection model
severity: medium (vendor)

description:
For the customer selection model, no ethics checklist has been provided. An ethics checklist, as seen in other models (e.g., BioCatch ETB Fraud Mobile UK V2), covers seven core principles such as: acting consistently with HSBC’s values, protecting privacy, starting with a clearly defined purpose, addressing bias in decision-making, ensuring accountability, adapting governance to meet emerging needs, and contributing to best practices. Each principle is accompanied by targeted questions—e.g., whether protected class attributes are used in decision-making, whether data sources are verifiable and sustainable, whether clear business sponsorship and oversight are in place, and how bias monitoring will be conducted.

In the absence of this documentation, it is not possible to confirm whether the customer selection model has been assessed for ethical considerations such as fairness, transparency, accountability, and governance alignment. These checks are essential to provide assurance that the model’s design, use of data, and monitoring processes meet required internal and regulatory standards.

business risk / consequence and justification of severity and classification:
The lack of an ethics checklist limits visibility into whether ethical safeguards—such as bias mitigation, data governance, privacy protection, and accountability—have been incorporated into the customer selection model. This creates uncertainty around the model’s readiness for audit, its compliance posture, and its defensibility with customers, regulators, or internal stakeholders. However, since the model’s development-phase performance metrics (AUC, GINI, KS) have been found to be stable, this issue is classified as medium severity.
