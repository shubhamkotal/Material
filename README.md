Got it — you want to keep it short, just expanding your two-sentence version into a fuller single paragraph without going too deep.

Here’s the expanded version:

Missing model assumptions testing:
The model is built using Logistic Regression, but important test assumptions related to this algorithm have not been documented. These include checks such as verifying the absence of multicollinearity, ensuring linearity of the logit for continuous predictors, and identifying any influential outliers that could distort results. Such tests are important to confirm that the model’s underlying assumptions hold true and that the coefficients and predictions remain stable and reliable. In the absence of these checks, there is limited assurance that the model outputs are statistically sound and free from bias introduced by assumption violations.

This keeps it short, but adds enough detail so it reads like a complete, strong pointer.
