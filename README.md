Sure! Here's the simplified version with meanings in brackets:

The model used log-transformed data with linear regression, but it has some issues. The data showed autocorrelation (when errors are related over time, instead of being random) and heteroscedasticity (when the error size changes across the data), which make the model’s results less reliable. Also, dummy variables (extra columns used to represent categories like holidays) were added without clear logic, especially when used repeatedly each year. Important checks like error distribution (whether errors follow a normal pattern), functional form (whether the correct type of relationship between variables is used), and stationarity (whether data patterns like average and variance stay constant over time) were not done. These problems affect how trustworthy the model’s predictions and conclusions are.
