MRI #05: Absence of Model Assumptions and Limitations Documentation. Severity: HIGH (New)

Description
No documentation has been provided outlining the key assumptions and limitations of the model. Understanding these factors is essential to ensure that the model is sound, fit for purpose, and appropriately interpreted. Without explicitly identifying and assessing assumptions, there is no validation that they are reasonable, valid, or well-supported.

Similarly, model limitations must be clearly defined to understand their impact on model outputs. Without this, stakeholders may misinterpret results or apply the model beyond its intended scope, leading to incorrect or suboptimal decisions. The lack of transparency around assumptions and limitations also makes it difficult to assess model robustness and reliability over time.

Business Risk / Consequence and Justification of Severity and Classification
Failing to document assumptions and limitations increases the risk of misinterpretation and misuse of the model. If key assumptions are flawed or untested, model predictions may be unreliable, potentially leading to incorrect business decisions. Additionally, an unclear understanding of limitations can result in applying the model to scenarios where it is not valid, further compromising its effectiveness.

Given these risks, the issue is classified with a Severity level of HIGH, as it directly impacts model governance, interpretability, and decision-making reliability. Clearly defining assumptions and limitations is crucial for ensuring model transparency, validity, and long-term usability.
