MRI #03: Lack of Ongoing Model Performance Assessment Despite Defined Monitoring Framework
Severity: HIGH (New)

Description

While a model monitoring framework is documented, ongoing performance assessment is missing. Without regular evaluation, potential issues like data drift, concept drift, and declining model accuracy may go undetected, leading to increased false positives or missed fraud cases.

Regular performance tracking ensures the model remains effective, stable, and aligned with evolving fraud patterns. The absence of this assessment raises concerns about model reliability, governance, and regulatory compliance.

Business Risk / Consequence and Justification of Severity

Failure to monitor model performance can result in financial losses, operational inefficiencies, and reputational damage. Undetected model degradation may lead to poor decision-making, increased fraud exposure, and non-compliance with regulatory expectations. Given these risks, the issue is classified as HIGH severity, impacting both fraud detection and business integrity.
