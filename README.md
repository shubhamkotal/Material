MRI #XX: misalignment between development and monitoring performance windows
Severity: MEDIUM (New)

Description:
The model was developed using a six-month observation period and a two-month performance period to measure customer response and derive model lift, aligned with the stated objective of identifying target customers based on short-term response behaviour. However, during ongoing monitoring, performance is assessed using a three-month performance window, which is inconsistent with the development framework.
The longer monitoring performance window increases the likelihood of capturing additional responses, which may artificially inflate observed lift—particularly in the top deciles. As a result, monitored performance metrics (currently showing lift of ~13) are not directly comparable to development benchmarks, reducing confidence that reported performance reflects true model effectiveness rather than extended response capture.

Business risk / consequence and justification of severity:
This misalignment may lead to overstated model performance, delayed identification of genuine deterioration, and sub-optimal business decisions related to targeting and campaign effectiveness. While no immediate performance concerns have been observed, the inconsistency undermines governance discipline and the reliability of monitoring outcomes; therefore, the residual risk is assessed as Medium.
