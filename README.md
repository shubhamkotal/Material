a) Missing model assumptions and proper documentation:
The model is built using Logistic Regression, but important assumptions related to this algorithm (like no multicollinearity, linear relationship between input variables and the log-odds, no extreme outliers, etc.) have not been tested or mentioned. These checks are necessary to ensure the model works correctly.

Also, other assumptions—such as those related to input data, model design, output usage, and business context—are either missing or scattered across different parts of the document. All key assumptions should be clearly written in one dedicated section. Without this, there is a risk that the model may be misunderstood or used incorrectly.
