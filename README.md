Data normalization and encoding not documented:
The CVQ does not specify how numerical variables were scaled or normalized, nor how categorical variables were encoded prior to model development. As these transformations directly impact model behavior and score stability, the lack of documentation limits transparency and raises uncertainty around consistent application during monitoring and production use.
