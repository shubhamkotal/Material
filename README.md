Since this is an acquisition model with ~1% event rate and the business uses only the top 5 deciles (top 50%) for targeting, the objective is still strong rank ordering—not maximizing overall recall. The model keeps the real-world class distribution appropriately, and stable OOT KS and AUC confirm that separation and ranking power are consistent. Using class weights would shift the probability distribution and likely increase false positives without clear evidence of improving business lift. As there is no indication of weak decile performance or instability, raising an MRI solely because class weighting was not applied does not meaningfully add value from either a technical or business standpoint.
