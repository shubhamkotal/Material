Voice scam (APP fraud) – A fraudster calls the victim, tricks them into believing a fake story, and convinces them to transfer money themselves. Since the victim uses their own phone, device, and passwords, all checks like OTP or MFA pass smoothly. That’s why it’s hard to detect.

Difference from account takeover (ATO):

In voice scam, the real customer makes the payment but under manipulation.

In account takeover, the fraudster directly steals login details and operates the account without the customer’s knowledge.
