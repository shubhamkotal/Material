UK model use case (MUC ID: GMIS-076550-MUC-00111283):
During the monitoring period, the Population Stability Index (PSI) was found to be 0.03%, indicating strong model stability. The modelâ€™s discriminatory power was assessed using the GINI coefficient, which stood at 67%, signifying acceptable model strength.
Conclusion: Based on both stability and strength metrics, the monitoring results for the UK use case are satisfactory.




Europe model use case (MUC ID: GMIS-076550-MUC-00111284):
The PSI was calculated to be 1.70%, which falls within the acceptable range, indicating the model remains stable. However, due to the absence of fraud volume during the monitoring period, GINI strength tests could not be performed, as the results would be statistically unreliable. FLOD has not defined a minimum fraud volume threshold below which statistical monitoring should be deemed inconclusive and expert judgment applied. As a result, IMR has raised a Medium Severity documentation MRI (MRI #01) noting the absence of a defined fraud volume threshold for statistical monitoring.
Conclusion: Despite the lack of strength testing, from a business perspective, the low fraud volume itself implies reduced fraud risk. Therefore, the monitoring results for the Europe use case are considered satisfactory.
