The absence of detailed documentation—particularly around data preprocessing, feature selection, and their replication during monitoring—poses significant risks to model transparency, reproducibility, validation effectiveness, and governance compliance. Without clear documentation, there is limited assurance that the model is being applied, monitored, and interpreted consistently with its original design, increasing the risk of undetected performance drift, incorrect conclusions, and audit or regulatory challenges. Given the potential impact on model reliability, ongoing monitoring integrity, and control environment, this issue is classified as high severity.
