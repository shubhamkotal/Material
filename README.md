l) No defined fraud volume threshold for monitoring
During the Q2 2024 monitoring, model strength was marked as acceptable because there were no fraud cases, so statistical tests couldnâ€™t be done. However, FLOD has not clearly defined how many fraud cases are needed to rely on statistical results, or when expert judgment should be used instead. This makes it unclear and inconsistent when deciding if the model performance is acceptable.
