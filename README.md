n) Improper baseline selection for monitoring metric comparison
The model monitoring report compares performance metrics between Q1 2024 and Q2 2024, calculating percentage changes using the previous monitoring period as the baseline. However, it does not explain why the development phase metrics were not used as the baseline for comparison. The rationale behind selecting the most recent monitoring period as the benchmark is not documented, which weakens transparency and may lead to misinterpretation of model performance trends over time.
