mri #XX: monitoring framework inconsistency and ks deterioration
severity: high (vendor)

description:
Recent monitoring indicates that the model’s Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) statistic has deteriorated by more than 25% compared to test-phase benchmarks, breaching the approved monitoring threshold. While no rank-ordering break has been observed, lift has not been measured despite being a required part of the monitoring plan alongside KS and rank ordering. In addition, there is a methodological inconsistency between development and monitoring: during model development, performance was evaluated on a three-month performance window after a one-month lag, whereas in monitoring only a two-month performance period was used after the lag. This inconsistency reduces the number of observed events and may artificially amplify the observed deterioration, raising concerns that the breach could be partly driven by insufficient sample size rather than genuine structural weakness. Nonetheless, based on the submitted monitoring framework, the KS breach constitutes a stop-use trigger, and the lack of lift measurement further limits confidence in assessing true model stability.

business risk / consequence and justification of severity and classification:
The observed deterioration and monitoring inconsistency represent a high-risk issue because the KS drop beyond 25% formally activates the stop-use criteria in the monitoring framework, requiring immediate suspension of the model. Failure to stop the model in light of this breach creates governance and compliance risk, while the absence of lift calculations weakens assurance that monitoring is being carried out in line with approved standards. Further, the inconsistent treatment of performance windows between development (three months) and monitoring (two months) undermines comparability of results, potentially masking true performance drivers or inflating breach signals due to lower event rates. This discrepancy erodes confidence in monitoring outcomes and suggests a gap in alignment between model design assumptions and ongoing monitoring practice. Given the material deterioration observed, the formal stop-use requirement, and the control weakness in monitoring execution, the issue is classified as high risk.
