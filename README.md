mri # 03: inadequate model implementation testing and documentation
Severity: MEDIUM (New)

Description:
Model implementation testing, such as User Acceptance Testing (UAT), lacks sufficient documentation for a third party to understand the process and results. The provided test documents do not clearly outline the implementation steps, making it difficult to validate that the developed and deployed models are identical. Additionally, there is no clear assessment of implementation results, limiting the ability to compare expected vs. actual model performance. Without detailed documentation, discrepancies between the development and implemented models may go unnoticed, impacting overall model reliability.

Business risk / Consequence and justification of severity and classification:
Incomplete implementation testing and unclear documentation introduce business risks. If the deployed model differs from the developed version or does not perform as expected, it may lead to incorrect customer targeting, financial losses, or operational inefficiencies. Without proper assessment, issues in model performance may remain undetected, reducing long-term effectiveness. However, as there are no immediate critical failures, the severity is classified as MEDIUM. Ensuring comprehensive testing and clear documentation is essential for maintaining model accuracy and operational confidence.
