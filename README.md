d) Missing documentation of model acceptance criteria: minimum ₹0.5M annualised incremental fraud loss save
The model documentation lacks a clearly defined acceptance criterion requiring at least ₹0.5M in annualised incremental fraud loss savings. Additionally, no formal business approval has been provided to validate that this threshold aligns with HSBC’s risk-reward expectations or operational targets.

e) Missing assessment for variable selection using PyCaret
There is no analysis, visualisation, or documentation to support how the final set of variables was chosen using PyCaret. Specifically, the model lacks evidence (e.g., performance trend graph) showing that peak performance was observed with the selected variable set, which limits transparency into the model optimisation process.
