2. Missing Rationale for Cut-off Score and Score Range
The rationale behind the chosen cut-off score and the defined score range is not documented. It’s unclear how the threshold was selected or which side of the score indicates higher event likelihood. This lack of clarity can lead to misinterpretation of model outputs and affect decision-making accuracy.

3. No Justification for Targeting Top 40 Percentile
There is no explanation for why only the top 40 percentile of events is targeted. Without supporting analysis or business rationale, it's difficult to assess whether this approach is optimal or aligned with objectives.


---

4. Unexplained Choice of 2-Month Performance Window
The basis for selecting a 2-month window to track customer actions, based on characteristics from 6 months prior, is not documented. This raises concerns about the timing alignment and the validity of model labeling and evaluation.


---

5. Undocumented Rules Used with Model Output
The rules that will be applied alongside the model output are not specified. This reduces transparency and hinders the ability to understand or audit how final decisions are made based on the model.
