Response:
The points raised are valid – WOE transformation, VIF, and coefficient significance already address most key assumptions. However, for completeness, it is generally expected to explicitly evidence the linearity between WOE-transformed variables and the log-odds (e.g., via IV/WOE plots).

Similarly, while the Implementation Report correctly shows a 100% match rate, it should also include supporting evidence such as a screenshot of the dashboard, platform/environment details, and a brief summary of UAT steps and sample size.

Action Plan: Partially met – add (i) linearity evidence via WOE plots and (ii) UAT summary with supporting proof of 100% match rate.
